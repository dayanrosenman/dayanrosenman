**News:** Starting October 2023, I'm on Sabbatical from BGU and joined [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/) as a Visiting Professor, Architect.

**About me:** 
I am an experienced physician leader with a board certification in Internal Medicine and Addiction Medicine, certification in HIV care, and more than a decade of clinical practice and supervision. My research interests are in population health management and integrated care design, with a focus on leveraging multimodal clinical analytics to optimize healthcare delivery for socially complex populations. I have both worked in and directed [Federally Qualified Health Centers](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federally-qualified-health-center-fqhc/) and demonstrated success in leading clinical program development that cohesively integrates medical, behavioral, and substance use care to enhance patient outcomes and care efficiency

#I'm an associate professor at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://in.bgu.ac.il/engn/ece/Pages/default.aspx), [Ben-Gurion University of the Negev](https://www.bgu.ac.il), Israel. I did my undergraduate studies at the department of communication system engineering, BGU.  I received my MSc and Ph.D. degrees in [computer science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in 2003 and 2006, respectively. I spent a sabbatical year during 2013-2014 as a visiting professor at [ICERM](http://icerm.brown.edu/sp-s14) and [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/), RI, USA. In 2018-2021 I served as the chair of the Communication Systems Engineering department at BGU. Since 2021 I'm also a senate member at BGU. Currently I'm also an asssoiate editor at [IEEE TNSM](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnsm).

My research lies at the intersection of systems and theory. I am motivated by real-life systems, their operations, and the problems and questions they present. My goal is to study the properties of these systems analytically to exploit them for the development of efficient algorithms. Please see some of my [selected publications](/publications#selected-publications) or the [complete list of publications](/publications#full-publication-list).

**Research Intrests:** I have a broad range of research interests, including networking, algorithms, social networks, and information theory. In particular, my current main research work is modeling and analysis of data-driven graphs and network algorithms emphasizing demand-aware and [self-adjusting networks](/publications#self-adjusting-netwroks). Additionally, I continue to work on [distributed systems](/publications#distributed-computing), [social networks](/publications#social-networks), [In-netwrok computing](/publications#in-netwrok-computing) and [randomized algorithms for networking](/publications#random-walks).

**Prospective Students:**  I'm always looking for new creative, and motivated students. If you are interested in any of the above topics, please, don't hesitate to drop me an e-mail and come to chat.
