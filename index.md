I am an experienced physician leader with board certification in Internal Medicine and Addiction Medicine, AAHIVM certification in HIV care, and more than a decade of clinical practice and supervision. My research interests are in population health management and integrated care design, with a focus on leveraging multimodal clinical analytics to optimize healthcare delivery for socially complex populations. I have both worked in and directed [Federally Qualified Health Centers](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federally-qualified-health-center-fqhc/) including at [Montefiore](https://www.montefiorehealthsystem.org/), [Housing Works](https://healthcare.housingworks.org/), [The Reach Project](https://www.reachprojectinc.org/), and [Callen Lorde](https://callen-lorde.org/), and demonstrated success in leading clinical program development that cohesively integrates medical, behavioral, and substance use care to enhance patient outcomes and care efficiency.

After 4 years at [Cityblock Health](https://www.cityblock.com/), I founded [Periscope Clinical Analytics](https://www.periscopeclinicalanalytics.com/), a boutique consulting firm enabling health organizations to embrace Value Based Care and population health management by identifying and focusing on their most complex patients.
